## Let's install some packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("shiny",
                   "dplyr",
                   "ggplot2",
                   "DT"
                   "devtools"))

devtools::install_github("juliasilge/southafricastats")
```

# What is a Shiny app? 

## A web application framework for R

- Shiny allows us as data scientists and analysts to turn our analyses written in R into interactive apps
- A Shiny app is run by a server (computer)

<img src="figs/new_app.png">

## Navigation

- Different viewing modes
- How do you close the app?
- Remember that your computer is running (i.e., serving) the app
- The app is *reactive*

## Shiny is flexible {.grid}

- Check out a [complex example](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/jcheng/scorecard-app/)
- What is in [the code](https://github.com/jcheng5/scorecard-app)?

# Inputs and outputs

## Reactive programming

- A Shiny app has an UI and a server function
- The UI controls how the app looks and is laid out
- The server function has the instructions about how to build the app

## Reactive programming

- Most of us who write R code are used to writing scripts to analyze data that are imperative or procedural (or maybe functional)
- A reactive paradigm focuses on how data will flow through the code and how changes propagate
- Reactive programming is important when a user is interacting with an interface

## First steps to reactivity

Reactivity occurs when an input value is used to render an output object

```{r, eval = FALSE}
selectInput(inputId = "province",
            label = "Province:",
            choices = unique(mortality$province),
            selected = "Gauteng")
```

## First steps to reactivity

Reactivity occurs when an input value is used to render an output object

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# calculations behind the scenes
server <- function(input, output) {
    
    output$mortalityPlot <- renderPlot({
        mortality %>%
            filter(province == input$province) %>%
            ggplot(aes(year, deaths, color = indicator)) +
            geom_line(alpha = 0.8, size = 1.5) +
            theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
    })
}
```

## First steps to reactivity {.grid}

Reactivity occurs when an input value is used to render an output object

- Be sure to add the necessary libraries at the beginning of the app
- Change the name of your output plot
- Do you want to filter out any of the mortality causes?

## A new kind of input

We can select more than one thing at a time

```{r, eval = FALSE}
selectInput(inputId = "province",
            label = "Province:",
            choices = unique(mortality$province),
            selected = "Gauteng",
            multiple = TRUE)
```

## A new kind of input

We can select more than one thing at a time

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# calculations behind the scenes
server <- function(input, output) {
    
    output$mortalityPlot <- renderPlot({
        mortality %>%
            filter(province %in% input$province) %>%
            ggplot(aes(year, deaths, color = indicator)) +
            geom_line(alpha = 0.8, size = 1.5) +
            facet_wrap(~province, scales = "free") +
            theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
    })
}
```

## Checkbox input

```{r, eval = FALSE}
checkboxInput(inputId = "show_data",
              label = "Show table?",
              value = FALSE)
```

## Checkbox input

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$mortalityTable <- renderDataTable({
    if(input$show_data){
        DT::datatable(data = selected_df())
    }
})
```

# Sharing your app

## With someone who has R installed?

- Share the code for your app (`app.R`)
- Your collaborator can run the app locally

## With everyone publicly?

- Publish using an account on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/)
- There are a variety of scalable options from free to \$\$\$
- I started with a free account and now pay for a starter account (after a few of my blog posts with Shiny apps got a lot of views)

## With people in your organization?

- Consider installing Shiny Server on a machine of your own
- It was much easier than I thought
- Check out RStudio's [clear, helpful instructions](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/)
